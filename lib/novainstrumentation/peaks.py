    Calculate the relative extrema of `data`.

    Relative extrema are calculated by finding locations where

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : ndarray
        Array in which to find the relative extrema.
    comparator : callable
        Function to use to compare two data points.
        Should take 2 numbers as arguments.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis over which to select from `data`.  Default is 0.
    order : int, optional
        How many points on each side to use for the comparison
        to consider ``comparator(n,n+x)`` to be True.
    mode : str, optional
        How the edges of the vector are treated.  'wrap' (wrap around) or
        'clip' (treat overflow as the same as the last (or first) element).
        Default 'clip'.  See numpy.take

    Returns
    -------
    extrema : ndarray
        Indices of the extrema, as boolean array of same shape as data.
        True for an extrema, False else.
